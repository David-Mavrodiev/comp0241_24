# Project Setup and Instructions

This project contains the `solutions.ipynb` notebook, which includes code and analysis requiring a specific Python environment to run correctly. This document provides instructions to set up the environment using either `environment.yml` (recommended for Conda users) or `requirements.txt` (for pip users).

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

1. Python (preferably 3.9 or later).
2. Either:
   - Conda installed (recommended). You can download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
   - pip installed for managing Python dependencies.
3. Jupyter Notebook installed (this is handled as part of the environment setup).

## Setting Up the Environment

You have two options to set up the environment:

### Option 1: Using `environment.yml` (For Conda Users)

If you are using Conda, install environment from the `environment.yml` and then use this environment to run `solutions.ipynb`.

### Option 2: Using `requirements.txt` (For Global Python Users)

If you don't have Conda, just global Python instance, then install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` and run `solutions.ipynb`.
